    ---------------------------------------------------------- About me - Eric Coe ----------------------------------------------------------
</h2>
<p class="second-text">
    My name is Eric and I am 16. <br> I am not involved in many of the school's activities,
    but I do attend and watch them time to time. <br>
    Some of my hobbies consist of playing games, listening to music, watching shows, and conversation with my friends.
    Some of the main shows I watched are
    <p class="second-text" id="highlghtedone">Arcane, One piece, and the horror Korean series "All of Us are dead."</p>
    <p class="second-text">
    I like exploring random shows I find and interact with the community with them.<br>
    My goal concerning High-School is to finish off strong, leaving with good grades and to up my GPA.
    After High-school I want to attend college and pursue a career in
    <p class="second-text" id="highlghtedtwo"> Cybersecurity or Computer Engineering. </p><br>

    <p class="second-text">I like the use of coding and want to be able to make a game one day, as a side project. <br>
    On the following page, there will be pictures of some of my interest and more that I didn't name yet.

    <p class="second-text">
    The overall theme of this webpage is the color scheme and character implementation of the Pirate-Strawhat chopper.
    For a brief overview of the character, resort to this link <br>
